Apache 2 virtual host management script
====

This BASH script is designed to manage development projects that are hosted with Apache on a localhost.  It can create/remove enable/disable a web project in a single command, allowing you to quickly and conveniently set up new projects.  It's purpose is to make it easier to create the necessary virtual hosts and hosts file entries for projects, and to keep project files out of site when not needed.  Be sure to configure the script before using.

Modify to your heart's desire.  Enjoy.
